.SH NAME
xqf \- 3D action game launcher and server browser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xqf
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBXQF\fP is a 3D action game (such as Quake, sequels and derivatives) server
browser. It uses X and is written using GTK+ 2 and uses QStat in the backend
to retrieve server info.
.PP
With XQF you can search for Quake, Quake 2/3/4, Quake World, Doom 3, Return to
Castle Wolfenstein, Hexen 2, Hexen World, Heretic 2, Sin, Half-Life, Kingpin,
Soldier of Fortun 1/2, Tribes 2, Unreal, Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament
2003/2004, Rune, Descent 3, Call of Duty, NetPanzer, Unvanquished, Xonotic,
Smokin' Guns, Warsow, Alien Arena, Urban Terror, Open Arena, World of Padman,
ZEQ2 Lite, Enemy Territory:Legacy, Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy and many others.
You can look at lots of information about the servers. XQF can spawn your
client into a selected server with customized options. You can also apply
filters while searching for servers, trimming full or empty servers, for
example.
.SH OPTIONS
 XQF accepts several command line parameters:
.TP
.BI \-\-launch " [SERVERTYPE] IP"
adds the server specified with IP (e.g. 10.10.0.1:27666) to the favorites,
queries it and launches the game. XQF tries to automatically determine the
correct game based on the port. If the autodetections fails XQF will ask you
for the game. Alternatively you may directly specify the game type on the
command line (e.g. Q3S).
.TP
.BI \-\-add " [SERVERTYPE] IP"
adds the specified server to the favories and queries it. Basically the same as
\-\-launch except that the game is not launched ;-)
.TP
.BI \-\-debug " level"
set the specified debug level. Use this if you experience problems with XQF.
Level 3 is usually sufficient for debugging most problems. Higher levels
product lots of output.
.TP
.B \-\-version
prints the version of XQF.
