- Multiple Favorites
- Detection if map is installed (req. home dir option)
- update game types for Q3 mods - move to external file
- Ability to delete servers from non-Favorites
- Game specific filters.  No use seeing a Lithium filter choice when looking
  at UT2003 servers
- Search for server like control f does for player

Required for XQF 1.0:
- Configure option for home directory as well as global directory
- Fix the server core dumps! (are there any left?)
- improve performance with huge server lists (halflife), maybe by serverside
  filtering
- More general server filters so one can filter based on any server var.
- Redial feature:  User configurable options
- Update statusbar when activating / deactivating serverfilter.  The number
  of shown servers does not get updated.
