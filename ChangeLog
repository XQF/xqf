  for reserved admin slots for the server.
  
Oct 13, 2002: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
- Updated q3_exec to search ~/.q3a and then real game dir for
  mods.  Tested with osp (~/.q3a/Osp)
- Created q2_exec function to be used by Quake2 to search ~/.quake2
  folder and then real game dir for mods.  Tested find_game_dir with
  Quake2-r0.14.1.  Connects and then restarts using lowercase name. 
  May work with other versions of Quake2.  Leaving in.
- g_free in find_game_dir and exec functions
- find_game_dir fixes:  Allow symlinks, use const
- Minor fix to ut_exec if there are no custom arguments

Oct 13, 2002: Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>
- add redial.c to POTFILES.
- updated Catalan and Spanish translations.

Oct 13, 2002: Ludwig Nussel <l-n@users.sourceforge.net>
- use server_clist_set_list in server_clist_build_filtered. It's actually
  faster to rebuild the displayed server list from scratch than to determine
  which servers have to be deleted or added.
- when deleting last server from favorites, do not display it any longer
- replace unsigned char type by enum server_type type
- grey out delete button for masters != favorites
- comment out unused redial code
- rename "Delete" -> "Remove from Favorites"
- update german translation
- remove empty lines for unconfigures games in statistics dialog

Oct 12, 2002: Ludwig Nussel <l-n@users.sourceforge.net>
- cleaned up get_custom_arguments
- custom_arg_count no longer neccessary
- suggest function for game commands
- show only configured games by default

Oct 11, 2002: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
- Modified q3_exec to call find_game_dir using quake3_data_dir
- Added NULL checks to find_game_dir

Oct 11, 2002: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
- Added function get_custom_arguments.  Used by ut_exec to pass user
  defined command line arguments to UT when launching.  Currently does 
  not have a GUI front end. To use, add something like the following
  to the [Game: UN] section in ~/.qf/config:

  custom_arg0=TacticalOps, -ini=TacticalOps.ini
  custom_arg1=SFTeamDM, -ini=StrikeForce.ini -userini=SFUser.ini
  custom_arg_count=2

  For UT, the 'gametype' server variable is compared with the entries
  in the config file above.  If there is a match, the arguments are 
  appended.

  For UT, the argument is appended to the IP address so you could 
  specify additional options such as ?Name=Alex etc.  If you want to
  pass - options, make sure you put a space after the comma like above.  

- Added function find_game_dir which searches for the game dir regardless
  of case.  Called by qw_exec, q2_exec_generic, q3_exec and hl_exec to set
  the game, or fs_game argument.  For example, if server has a game of 
  'OSP', and client has dir of 'osp', Q3 will now be properly be launched
  with +fs_game osp instead of OSP.

Oct 10, 2002: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>

- Changed Unreal name to 'Unreal / UT'

Oct 04, 2002: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>

  q3a game types, options for setting fs_game on the command line and
  r3a hack for the vm_* settings.
  
Aug 9, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
-Changed Quake3 protocol version to 66 to support
 latest Quake3 patch.  Change located in game.c

July 07, 2001, Bill Adams <bill@evilbill.org>
- Added "Game Type" filter.  Now you can filter on 
  CTF, TDM, etc. and the mod.
- Merged Jordi's changes (see below).
  
June 8, 2001, Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>
- Big internationalization patch for XQF.
  Adds intl/ and po/ subdirs, and adds the gettext marks
  to every .c that needs it. Modified configure.in and 
  the Makefile.am's to support gettext. From now on,
  every string in the code should be wrapped inside
  gettext() calls, and .c's should add a <libintl.h>
  if they don't have it already.
  Some issues with the current code remain (untranslatable
  strings), thats a work in progress.
- Initial, incomplete Spanish translation (po/es.po).
- changed configure.in so it barfs about qstat << 2.4c.

June 5, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
-Tribes 2 games can now be launched.  Created a t2_exec
 function. If a name is specified in Player Profile, it 
 is used on the command line to log in.  This would only
 work if you have saved your password in the game.
 Otherwise it launches and prompts for login.

April 20, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
-Now requires qstat2.4c.  Removed fixes to Tribes 2 code
 for qstat2.4b as qstat2.4c fixes the problems
-Added t2_analyze_serverinfo function to decode Game and
 GameType columns for Tribes 2.

April 19, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
-Changed version to 0.9.6g
-Added Tribes 2 support.  Tribes 2 support requires at
 least QSTAT 2.4b.  As I do not even have Tribes 2 I
 can not test launching the game but it if it launches
 the same as Quake2, then it should work.  More work
 will be done to ensure the player and server info is
 being decoded correctly etc.

Feb 14, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Oh dear god, I think I fixed the core dumps related
 to the reference counting on the server structures.
 At least to the best of my ability, I cannot make
 the server references increase or decrease
 over time: i.e. the program always exits with
 a reference count of one on all server structures.
 I could not figure out why it was 1 and not zero
 but I will deal with that later.

Feb 13, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Changed version to 0.9.6f, added announcement dir
 and announcement.

Feb 07, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Fixed the core dumps (for the most part) for real.
 The only time I have seen a core dump at this point
 is when updating a master list where there are not
 any servers already in the list.  However, once
 you have a list of servers, you should be able to
 update/refresh at will without any problems.
-Lots of debugging code with the debug(...) call. If
 you want lots of output, use -d 3, to see the servers
 it is parsing use -d 4. For an insane amount of output
 use -d 7.  Debug levels greater than three will
 will have so much output that it will most likely 
 slow down the program.
-Added a fair number of comments to the code.

Jan 31, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Made it so OSP game types show up correctly.

Jan 24, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Fixed the game.c hack.  Bad bug.
	
Jan 23, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Did BAD hack to game.c::q3_exec( ) so that when
 connecting to an arena (rocket arena 3) server,
 it will "+set sv_pure 0 +set vm_* 0" on the command
 line so arena will load properly.  As a side note,
 one should use vm_* all at zero unless you have a 
 really good reason to do otherwise.
	
Jan 21, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Changed "Insert" behavior.  Now Insert brings up the add
 server dialog while SHIFT+Insert adds a server from the 
 server list to your favorites.  I am not sure about 
 this because one can also use CTRL+N to add another 
 server via a dialog. But I am told the Insert == Dialog
 is how GameSpy works so there it is.
-q3_exec now adds +set fs_game SSSS for either the
 fs_game or gamename.  This should improve connecting
 as it will load the mod when Q3A starts.
-Added a function in util.c to get the value for
 any server variable that shows up in the server info
 pane.  This is a setup for arbitrary server filters
 and for...
-q3_exec will now check for <quake3exec>protoNN before
 it just runs <quake3exec>.  To use this feature you
 have to configure xqf to point to the FULL path to
 your q3 exec script.  Then you can put scripts that
 are named with the "protoNN" on the end to have xqf
 automatically connect to the right server.  See
 the instructions in the README.  This allows you (if
 you have LOTS of disk space) to be able to connect to
 multiple point-releases.
-added -d N command line option to get more debugging
 output.  Added debug.c and debug.h to facilitate this
 new feature.  Only a few code segments use the new
 debug() function.
-added self to AUTHORS.
-Version now 0.9.6e-beta.
-Fixed config.in to have the correct version.

 TeamArena uses in the in-game browser.

Jan 1, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>

 game for use with ICQ scripts etc.  Toggle on / off using Preferences / 
 Appearance

-Modified game.c to query for protocol 48 Quake3 servers instead of the
 qstat default by using "-q3m,48"

Dec 27, 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Adding a server with the Insert key now gives feedback on the status bar.
-Fixed the core dump.  Perhaps?  So I hope. (added server_ref to 
 server.c::server_add( )). This will require verification on the reference
 count but it seemed to fix it for me.

Dec 23, 2000: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>
-Added new Quake3 game types to support Team Arena.  Note: g_gametype values
 of 5 to 8 are now defined by id for Team Arena.  Mod authors usually use 5.
 XQF will only show the new values if the game version is 1.27 until we find
 out what the mod authors are doing.
-Changed game types to not use < > around the type in the Game column

Dec 22, 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-New column in the server list to show if you need a password or not. If
 you do a lock icon appears.
-If a Q3A server has all non private-client slots filled, a yellow man
 appears next to the map.  The icon is slightly different for color blind
 people so don't tell me about it unless you are color blind and need the
 difference greater.
-You can press "Insert" to add a server to the Favorites list while in
 anything but the Favorites list.  Pressing "Delete" while in the Favorites
 list will remove it from Favorites.  "Enter" or "Return" in any list will
 will connect you to the server.
-Moved the filter selection to the "Server" menu pulldown.
-It still dumps core. :(. There seems to be a reference counting bug
 with the server lists.  If you want to watch it happen, set up a
 "mod contains wfa" filter, update the Q3A ID list, apply the filter, and
 press refresh repeatedly.

Dec 20th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
--The filter name now appears in the status bar.
--Version changed to 0.9.6b-beta
--There are still core dumps :(.

Dec 04th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Added the ability to have multiple filters.  Right now the
 number is set at compile time to 10 (see xqf.h:MAX_SERVER_FILTERS
 if you want to change it).  You can name the filters to 
 whatever you want.  The first filter "None" cannot be changed.
 It is there for a reason (future feature). The last filter selected
 is remembered each time you exit (if you use the menu File->exit).
-Version changed to 0.9.6a-beta

Nov 26th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>

Nov 5th 2000: Alex Burger <alex@users.sourceforge dot net>

 after a player filter is applied
